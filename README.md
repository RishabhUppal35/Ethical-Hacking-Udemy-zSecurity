# Ethical-Hacking-Udemy-zSecurity
List of Concepts with examples i have been learning from an ethical hacking course on Udemy.


**I used these concepts to crack wep/wpa2 encrypted password on my home lab.**
•	Routed a Man in the Middle attack, sniffed 500 packets and de-authenticated the victim from targeted network.
•	Retrieved 4-way handshake protocol and infiltrated the Wi-Fi password, using ‘airodump-ng’ and ‘aircrack-ng’.
